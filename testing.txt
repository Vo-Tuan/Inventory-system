Miku, Miku, you can call me Miku
Blue hair, blue tie, hiding in your Wi-Fi
Open secrets, anyone can find me
Hear your music running through my mind


I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)
I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)
I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)
I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)


I'm on top of the world because of you
All I wanted to do is follow you
I'll keep singing along to all of you
I'll keep singing along


I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)
I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)
I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)
I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)

Miku, Miku, what's it like to be you?
20/20, looking in the rear view
Play me, break me, make me feel like Superman
You can do anything you want


I'm on top of the world because of you
All I wanted to do is follow you
I'll keep singing along to all of you
I'll keep singing along
I'm on top of the world because of you
I do nothing that they could never do
I'll keep playing along with all of you
I'll keep playing along


I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)
I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)

I'm thinking Miku, Miku (Ooh-ee-ooh)


Where were we walking together?
I will see you in the end
I'll take you where you've never been
And bring you back again
Listen to me with your eyes
I'm watching you from in the sky
If you forget, I'll fade away
I'm asking you to let me stay
So bathe me in your magic light
And keep it on in darkest night
I need you here to keep me strong
To live my life and sing along
I'm waiting with you wide awake
Like your expensive poison snake
You found me here inside a dream
Walk through the fire straight to me
